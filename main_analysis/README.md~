- substitution_effects: Testing the different substitute rules and using the best to find the substitute pairs
- suggestion_function: this ranks the products by their predicted mkt share and returns the suggested products; no substitution effects included
- suggestion_with_substitution_effect: this file takes into acctount both the suggestions and the substitution effects
